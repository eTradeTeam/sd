# Signal Library Concept

**The Team needs to discuss the use of a signal library**.

The signal library is an initial concept.  The benefit, use and configuration of a signal library should be discussed by the team


# Building and Managing the Signal Library

This document outlines our standard procedures for building and managing the Signal Library—a central repository for all potential trading signals that our team researches, tests, and refines. Maintaining an organized and up-to-date signal log ensures that everyone on the team has access to high-quality ideas, supports collaboration, and provides a historical record of our evolving methodology.

## 1. Purpose of the Signal Library

- **Centralize Ideas:** Collect and archive all signal ideas (e.g., technical indicators, chart patterns, market structure observations, or AI-generated concepts) in one accessible location.
- **Documentation:** Provide detailed descriptions, rationale, testing results, and relevant references for each signal.
- **Prioritization:** Classify signals by potential usefulness, suitability for certain market conditions, and strategic category (e.g., trend-following, mean reversion).
- **Continuous Improvement:** Enable team members to review, update, or discard signals based on new insights or additional test results.

## 2. Structure of the Signal Library

We will manage the signal library through a dedicated file (e.g., `signal_library.md`) and, if needed, a linked spreadsheet for advanced data analysis. Each signal entry should include the following sections:

- **Signal Name:** A descriptive title (e.g., “RSI Oversold Reversal”).
- **Category:** The strategy type it might fit into (e.g., Mean Reversion, Trend Following).
- **Description:** A concise explanation of the signal, including its purpose and how it is derived (e.g., “Triggered when the RSI falls below 30 and then crosses above 30, indicating a potential oversold reversal.”).
- **Methodology:** Details on how the signal is calculated or identified, including technical indicators and formula parameters.
- **Data Requirements:** The type of data used (OHLC, volume, order flow) and any necessary timeframes.
- **Initial Testing Results:** Summary metrics from preliminary backtests, such as win rate, profit factor, average trade result, and drawdown.
- **Observations & Potential Improvements:** Any qualitative notes on performance or conditions where the signal performs well or poorly.
- **Version & Revision History:** Date of entry, updates, and changes made based on further research or testing.

Example Entry:

```markdown
### RSI Oversold Reversal

- **Category:** Mean Reversion
- **Description:** A signal that triggers a long entry when the RSI drops below 30 and subsequently crosses above 30, suggesting a potential bounce from oversold conditions.
- **Methodology:**  
  - RSI Period: 14  
  - Trigger: RSI < 30, then crossover above 30 within one bar.
- **Data Requirements:** Daily OHLC data for equities.
- **Initial Testing Results:**  
  - Win Rate: 54%  
  - Profit Factor: 1.3  
  - Notable Drawdowns during high volatility periods.
- **Observations & Potential Improvements:**  
  - Consider adding a volatility filter to avoid false signals in highly choppy markets.
- **Revision History:**  
  - *2023-09-10:* Initial entry based on preliminary backtests.
  - *2023-10-05:* Updated testing results and added volatility filter note.

## 3. Process for Adding New Signals

1. **Idea Submission:**  
   - When a team member identifies a new potential signal, they document the idea following the structure above.
   - Submit the entry as a pull request to the `signal_library.md` file, or add it to the shared spreadsheet if using one.

2. **Peer Review:**  
   - Other team members review the new entry for clarity, feasibility, and consistency with our documentation standards.
   - Feedback is provided via comments on the pull request or through designated channels (e.g., Discord).

3. **Approval and Merging:**  
   - Once the signal entry meets the quality criteria, a team lead will merge the changes into the main branch.
   - The new signal becomes part of our centralized repository and is available for further testing and development.

## 4. Process for Updating and Managing the Library

1. **Regular Reviews:**  
   - The team will conduct periodic reviews (monthly or quarterly) of the signal library to assess signal performance based on new data.
   - Signals that consistently underperform or are no longer relevant will be flagged for removal or revision.

2. **Version Control:**  
   - Maintain clear revision history within each entry.  
   - Use Git commit messages and pull request discussions to document changes over time.

3. **Collaboration and Discussion:**  
   - Utilize our communication channels (e.g., Discord, team meetings) to discuss potential improvements or issues with existing signals.
   - Encourage team members to propose enhancements or share results from additional testing.

4. **Archiving Old Signals:**  
   - Signals deemed obsolete or non-viable can be moved to an “Archive” section at the bottom of the signal library file. This preserves historical data and reasoning for why a particular signal was retired.

---

## 5. Tools and Integration

- **Markdown File (`signal_library.md`):**  
  - The primary document that forms the core of the signal library.
- **Spreadsheet (Optional):**  
  - For advanced data tracking and analysis, maintain a complementary spreadsheet that includes quantitative metrics for each signal. Ensure that this spreadsheet is regularly updated and linked in the signal library.
- **GitHub Issues:**  
  - Use issues to track discussions on specific signals or to propose signal improvements. Reference these issues in the signal entries where relevant.

## 6. Conclusion

A well-maintained signal library is fundamental to our strategy development process. By documenting and rigorously reviewing each signal, we create a rich repository of ideas that can be combined, refined, and tested to build robust trading strategies. Consistent updates, peer reviews, and version tracking will help us ensure that our signal library remains a valuable resource for all team members.

This structured approach to building and managing the signal library lays the foundation for transparent, data-driven research and collaboration within the team. Happy signal hunting!
