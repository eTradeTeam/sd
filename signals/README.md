# Signals Directory Overview

:arrow_forward: <mark>IMPORTANT: This section is a concept draft.  Please review and discuss this section for improvements.</mark>

The **Signals** directory is a dedicated space for storing all research, documentation, and analysis related to identifying and developing potential trading signals. This is where our team captures every idea—from initial observations to quantitative validations—that could lead to a robust trading strategy. The documents in this directory provide a structured approach to signal discovery, tracking, and evaluation.

## Purpose

- **Centralized Signal Library:**  
  Maintain a collection of potential trading signals in one accessible repository. This helps everyone review, compare, and build on existing ideas.

- **Documentation & Tracking:**  
  Record the rationale, methodologies, and testing results of each signal. Detailed documentation ensures that every team member understands the underlying hypothesis and can replicate or refine it as needed.

- **Basis for Strategy Development:**  
  Signals form the foundation of our trading strategies. By carefully identifying and validating signals, we increase the chances of developing profitable and robust systems.

- **Collaboration & Continuous Improvement:**  
  Encourage open discussion and feedback on each signal. Team members are invited to contribute new ideas, update existing signals, and document performance metrics over time.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Identify Signals:**  
  Detailed guides such as [identify_signals.md](./identify_signals.md) explain methodologies for discovering and validating trading signals.

- **[Signal Library](signal_library.md) / Log:**  
  A record of all signal ideas, including technical indicators, chart patterns, market structure observations, or AI-generated concepts. This library may be maintained in a shared spreadsheet or an additional `.md` file (e.g., signal_library.md).

- **Testing & Validation Data:**  
  Documentation of initial backtests and quick feasibility checks for new signals. These files highlight key performance metrics and help filter out ideas that lack a clear edge.

- **Categorization & Prioritization:**  
  Signals are often organized by strategy type or market condition (e.g., trend-following signals, mean reversion signals). This helps in aggregating similar ideas and choosing the most promising ones for further development.

## How to Use This Directory

1. **Review Existing Signals:**  
   Familiarize yourself with the current signal ideas and their documented results before proposing new ones. This avoids duplication and helps build on proven methodologies.

2. **Contribute New Ideas:**  
   If you identify a new signal, follow the guidelines in [identify_signals.md](./identify_signals.md) to document your observation, include preliminary test results, and add it to the signal log.

3. **Engage in Discussions:**  
   Use team meetings or our communication channels (see [communications.md](../Team/communications.md)) to discuss potential improvements or concerns about existing signals. Collaboration is key to refining our ideas.

4. **Reference in Strategy Development:**  
   When building or adjusting a trading strategy, refer back to this directory to see which signals have been vetted, and how they might integrate into broader entry and exit rules.

By maintaining a well-organized **Signals** directory, we ensure our entire team has access to high-quality, thoroughly documented ideas that drive our trading strategies. This structured approach helps us continuously innovate and improve our methodology, ultimately enhancing our trading performance over time.
