 - Review the [Onboarding](team/onboarding_guide.md): Includes overview of tools the team uses.
 - Take a look at the [Strategy Process](process) Documents
 
## Overview

The repository is organized to guide you through:

1. **Team Collaboration**: How do we work as a team.  How can you best utilize your skills.
1. **Research & Ideation**: Identifying market inefficiencies, selecting relevant data, and defining your initial hypothesis.  
2. **Strategy Design**: Developing core logic, selecting indicators, and determining timeframes.  
3. **Validation**: Backtesting, walk-forward testing, and performance evaluation.  
4. **Deployment**: Implementation on a live or simulated environment with risk controls.  

For details on specific **strategy categories** (e.g., Trend Following, Mean Reversion, Momentum, Breakout, etc.), see [strategy_types.md](process/strategy_types.md).

# Welcome to the Strategy Development Team!

We‚Äôre thrilled to have you join our **collaborative effort** to research, build, and deploy algorithmic trading strategies. In this space, we‚Äôll exchange ideas, outline responsibilities, and support each other in creating robust and profitable systems.

## Team Meetings & Communication

- **Weekly Zoom Meetings**  
  - We‚Äôll hold a **weekly Zoom call** to review progress, discuss challenges, and share insights.  
  - Link to join: [Zoom Meeting Link](#)  
  - Check the shared calendar or Slack/Discord for meeting times and reminders.  
- **Slack/Discord Channel**  
  - Daily communication and quick questions can be handled in our dedicated channel.  
  - Feel free to post code snippets, screenshots, or link to references there.

## Strategy Development Process

We will **develop strategies** in a range of categories (e.g., Trend Following, Mean Reversion, Breakout, etc.). An **outline** of this process‚Äîincluding initial idea generation, backtesting, and deployment‚Äîcan be found in our [Development Process Overview](#). Additionally, our [Strategy Categories](#) document details each category‚Äôs unique approach, typical indicators, and market conditions.

## Team Roles & Skill Sets

We‚Äôre leveraging multiple perspectives and talents to ensure each strategy benefits from a **diverse range of expertise**. Below are the primary roles:

1. **Chartists**  
   - Analyze price action visually.  
   - Identify potential patterns, support/resistance zones, and trend structures.  
   - Provide the ‚Äúart‚Äù of chart reading to complement systematic ideas.

2. **Indicator Developers**  
   - Research and refine technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands, custom scripts).  
   - Optimize indicator parameters and test their robustness across market regimes.

3. **Strategy Coders**  
   - Translate trading logic into code (e.g., EasyLanguage for TradeStation, C# for NinjaTrader).  
   - Implement entry/exit rules, manage data feeds, and ensure efficient backtesting.  

4. **Strategy Framework Developers**  
   - Build or enhance our overarching framework to streamline testing, optimization, and reporting.  
   - Maintain version control, integrate new libraries, and manage data pipelines.  

5. **Money Management & Risk Specialists**  
   - Design position-sizing algorithms and risk overlays (e.g., ATR-based sizing, drawdown controls).  
   - Work with developers to integrate robust money management rules into each strategy.

While you may have a **primary role**, collaboration is encouraged‚Äîcross-functional input makes for stronger overall strategies.

## Available Resources

- **Shared Documentation**  
  - A central repository of guides, best practices, and the roadmap is available in our [team wiki](#).  
  - Our [strategy_types.md](#) file (within the repo) details the various strategy categories and indicators.

- **Data & Platform Access**  
  - You‚Äôll find sample datasets (OHLC, volume, tick) in our `/data` directory.  
  - Licenses or platform logins (e.g., TradeStation, MultiCharts, NinjaTrader) can be requested from the project lead if needed.

- **Coding & Testing Frameworks**  
  - Example scripts and template files are located in `/scripts` within our main repository.  
  - Our pipeline includes backtesting frameworks supporting multiple languages.

## Next Steps

1. **Introduce Yourself**  
   - Share your background, primary skill set, and areas of interest in the Slack/Discord channel.  

2. **Pick a Strategy Category**  
   - Start by exploring the [Strategy Categories](#). Decide where you‚Äôd like to contribute or lead.  

3. **Collaborate & Contribute**  
   - Open or respond to GitHub issues in the repository, post questions in Slack/Discord, and join the weekly Zoom calls.  

Thank you for being part of this project‚Äîtogether, we‚Äôll leverage our collective strengths and build exceptional trading systems. Let‚Äôs get started!

## Strategy Segmentation

We segment algorithms into high-level **categories** and **subcategories** based on their underlying market philosophy and approach. Each category highlights typical indicators, market conditions, and risk profiles. For example:

- **Trend Following**: Moving Average Crossovers, Price Channels, Ichimoku  
- **Mean Reversion**: RSI Reversion, Bollinger Mean Reversion  
- **Momentum**: Price Momentum, Volume-Weighted Momentum  
- **Breakout**: Volatility Expansion, Opening Range  
- ‚Ä¶and more

**Full List**: Visit [strategy_types.md](./strategy_types.md) for a comprehensive overview and an expanded list of subcategories, along with the indicators typically used.

## Development Process

Below is a simplified workflow for building and refining a trading strategy:

1. **Idea Generation**  
   - Brainstorm market inefficiencies or technical setups.  
   - Examine historical data or known patterns (e.g., price action, volume surges).
   - See the [Strategy Types](strategy_types.md) for a breakdown and approach for identifying strategy ideas

2. **Data Collection & Analysis**  
   - Gather historical OHLC, volume, or tick data.  
   - Filter relevant features (e.g., indicators, volatility measures).

3. **Strategy Definition**  
   - Define entry/exit rules.  
   - Decide on timeframes (1-min, 5-min, daily) and trading styles (scalping, swing, position).  
   - Establish risk management criteria (stop-loss, position sizing).

4. **Backtesting & Optimization**  
   - Run initial backtests to see if the hypothesis holds.  
   - Optimize parameters (e.g., moving average lengths) with caution to avoid overfitting.

5. **Walk-Forward & Out-of-Sample Testing**  
   - Validate the strategy on different time periods to ensure robustness.  
   - Adjust rules or indicators if performance is subpar.

6. **Deployment**  
   - Implement on a trading platform (TradeStation, MultiCharts, NinjaTrader).  
   - Monitor real-time performance and risk.

7. **Monitoring & Iteration**  
   - Regularly evaluate the strategy‚Äôs drawdowns, win rates, and risk profile.  
   - Adapt to changing market conditions.
