# Team Charter

## 1. Purpose & Scope

Our **Algorithmic Strategy Development** team brings together traders, developers, and researchers to:
- **Collaboratively build, refine, and deploy** systematic trading strategies.
- **Leverage Kevin Davey’s Strategy Factory principles** along with other robust development methodologies.
- Maintain a focus on **risk management, scalability, and adaptability** in ever-changing market environments.

This charter defines how we operate, make decisions, and uphold responsibilities, ensuring that each member’s talents are maximized for collective success.

---

## 2. Objectives

1. **Produce Robust Trading Systems**  
   - Design strategies that are tested thoroughly (backtesting, walk-forward, Monte Carlo, etc.).  
   - Aim for **risk-adjusted returns** over raw profit or unrealistic gains.

2. **Encourage Skill Development**  
   - Promote ongoing education in coding, quantitative methods, and technical/fundamental analysis.  
   - Share knowledge freely across roles (chartists, developers, quants, testers, etc.).

3. **Foster a Collaborative Culture**  
   - Encourage open communication, feedback, and peer review.  
   - Align each contributor’s expertise (coding, signal design, money management) to create synergy.

4. **Maintain Transparency & Accountability**  
   - Document strategy ideas, testing outcomes, and decisions.  
   - Use GitHub issues, pull requests, and monthly/quarterly reviews to track progress.

---

## 3. Membership & Roles

We recognize several functional roles within the team (though one member may serve multiple roles):

- **Chartists / Market Analysts**: Identify market structure, key price levels, and potential signal ideas.  
- **Indicator / Signal Developers**: Convert market insights into algorithmic indicators and logic modules.  
- **Strategy Developers**: Integrate signals into cohesive strategies, handle coding in TradeStation, MultiCharts, NinjaTrader, or other platforms.  
- **Strategy Testers**: Conduct backtests, parameter sweeps, and walk-forward analyses; compile performance reports.  
- **Money Management Specialists**: Oversee risk controls, position sizing, and drawdown thresholds.  
- **Project / Team Leads**: Coordinate tasks, prioritize incoming ideas, and ensure alignment with overall goals.  
- **AI/GenAI Specialists** (Optional): Explore generative AI tools for accelerating or enhancing certain phases of development.

For a detailed breakdown, see [team_roles.md](./team_roles.md).

## 4. Key Responsibilities

1. **Idea Generation & Research**  
   - Each member is encouraged to propose new strategies or signals.  
   - Provide sufficient **rationale and preliminary data** to support new ideas.

2. **Code Quality & Version Control**  
   - All code changes, indicators, or documentation updates **must go through pull requests** on GitHub.  
   - Thorough **peer review** is expected to maintain high-quality standards.

3. **Testing & Validation**  
   - Strategies must undergo **feasibility testing** (initial checks), followed by rigorous multi-market and walk-forward tests.  
   - The testing team provides feedback on potential overfitting or coding errors.

4. **Documentation**  
   - Maintain descriptive **commit messages**, **readmes**, and **changelogs**.  
   - **Use Markdown format** to create clear, easy-to-read `.md` files. Markdown is a lightweight text-based syntax that supports headings, lists, links, and more, making it simple to version-control and view on GitHub.  
   - Update relevant `.md` files whenever new strategies are introduced, existing ones are modified, or processes change.

5. **Communication**  
   - Regular participation in **team meetings** (Discord/Zoom) or asynchronous updates.  
   - Timely responses to pull requests, issues, and direct messages.

6. **Adherence to Code of Conduct**  
   - Uphold the standards outlined in [Code_of_conduct.md](./Code_of_conduct.md).  
   - Treat fellow contributors with professionalism and respect.

---

## 5. Decision-Making & Governance

1. **Proposal Process**  
   - Any member can propose new indicators, strategies, or changes.  
   - Each proposal should be documented in a GitHub issue with relevant data or references.

2. **Review & Consensus**  
   - Major decisions (e.g., adopting a new strategy or pivoting to new markets) require **agreement from the Team Leads** and **input from subject matter experts**.  
   - Minor decisions (e.g., small parameter tweaks, bug fixes) can be made by individuals following peer review.

3. **Conflict Resolution**  
   - In case of disagreements, the project leads will facilitate a discussion and aim for consensus.  
   - If consensus cannot be reached, a **majority vote** among the leads or a **predefined decision-maker** (e.g., a principal founder) resolves the issue.

---

## 6. Collaboration Tools & Practices

1. **Version Control & GitHub**  
   - Primary platform for **code sharing, issue tracking, and pull requests**.  
   - Branch naming conventions: `feature/`, `fix/`, `documentation/`, etc.

2. **Communication Channels**  
   - **Discord** for real-time discussion, quick questions, or brainstorming.  
   - **Zoom** (or similar) for scheduled strategy reviews and code walkthroughs.

3. **Project Management**  
   - GitHub Projects or a Kanban board can be used to track tasks and progress.  
   - Each task or strategy initiative should have a clear owner and timeline.

4. **Regular Check-Ins**  
   - **Weekly/biweekly** short syncs for open tasks.  
   - **Monthly** or **quarterly** deeper review sessions to measure overall strategy performance.

---

## 7. Performance & Rewards

We believe in rewarding active contributors:

1. **Contribution-Based Access**  
   - Members who consistently contribute (research, code, testing) gain access to monthly strategy repositories and data.  
   - Non-active members may have limited access according to [contribution_based_rewards.md](./contribution_based_rewards.md).

2. **Recognition & Growth**  
   - Standout contributions may lead to **elevated roles** (e.g., lead developer, head of testing).  
   - Acknowledge top contributors in internal announcements or special sessions.

---

## 8. Maintenance & Evolution

This charter is a **living document**. Team leads will review it **annually** (or as needed) to:
- Reflect lessons learned from new market conditions or development practices.  
- Incorporate any organizational or technological changes.

**Proposed updates** to the charter can be submitted via pull requests, with final approval from a majority of the leads.
