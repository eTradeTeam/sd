# Welcome to Our Proprietary Trading Team

We are a **collective of passionate traders, quantitative researchers, and technologists**, all **students of Kevin Daveyâ€™s Strategy Factory course**, working together to **innovate and refine algorithmic trading strategies**. Our approach is fully collaborative - **every aspect of strategy development** is a team effort, and the resulting strategies are made available to all members. 

Each team member has the flexibility to work across the entire workflow or to specialize in the area that best matches their strengths. For instance, one member might focus on identifying and testing signals, another may concentrate on rigorous strategy testing after feasibility checks, while others might develop the overarching strategy framework, build money management logic, or manage portfolio allocation. This collaborative structure ensures that each individual can pursue their primary interests, knowing that other critical areas are covered by the team.
