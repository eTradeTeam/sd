# Team Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the eTradeTeam! Weâ€™re excited to have you join our collaboration of students from Kevin Davey's Strategy Factory Course. This guide will walk you through how to get started, gain access to private repos, and contribute effectively to the team.

## Step 1: Read the Team Charter & Code of Conduct

Before joining, please review the following:

## Step 2: Request Access to Private Repositories

To contribute, you'll need access to our private strategy and tooling repos.

1. **Create a GitHub account** if you donâ€™t already have one.
2. **Send your GitHub username** to the team lead or submit a request via [this onboarding issue](https://github.com/etradeteam/strategy_development/issues).
3. Youâ€™ll receive invitations to join the organization and gain repo access.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Development Environment

Each repo contains its own setup instructions. General setup includes:

- Installing **Git** and cloning repos locally
- Setting up **Python** (or NinjaTrader / MultiCharts / platform of choice)
- Installing any required libraries (see `requirements.txt` or `README.md`)

Optional:
- Sign up for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), Claude, or other GenAI tools to contribute prompts in the `genai` repo.

## Step 4: Introduce Yourself

Please introduce yourself in the [Introductions Discussion](https://github.com/etradeteam/strategy_development/discussions) and include:

- Your name or nickname
- Strategy Factory wave or year
- Your trading interests (e.g., breakout, mean reversion)
- Any coding or trading experience you'd like to share

## Step 5: Make Your First Contribution

Choose a starting point based on your interest:

| Framework or utilities | Head to `strategy_framework` or `money_management` |
| AI prompt development | Explore or contribute to `genai` |
| Documentation or research | Add to `references` or improve repo READMEs |

Suggested first steps:

## Step 6: Stay Active

To maintain access:
- Make at least one contribution or check-in every **30â€“60 days**

Weâ€™re all here to learn and grow â€” participation is what makes the eTradeTeam valuable!
