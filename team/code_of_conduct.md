# Team Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Team — a collaborative, respectful, and professional community of developers, traders, and learners.

This Code of Conduct sets expectations for behavior and contributions across all eTradeTeam repositories and communication channels. By participating in this organization, you agree to abide by this code.

---

## Our Guiding Principles

We value:
-  **Respectful Collaboration**
-  **Curiosity and Lifelong Learning**
-  **Transparency and Accountability**
-  **Pragmatic Problem Solving**
-  **Constructive Communication**

---

## Expected Behavior

All members are expected to:
- Be welcoming, inclusive, and patient with all skill levels and backgrounds
- Respect differing opinions, experiences, and perspectives
- Offer and accept feedback graciously
- Keep discussions focused on the work, not the person
- Support the goals of the team by contributing knowledge, effort, or ideas

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

We will not tolerate:
- Harassment, bullying, or intimidation in any form
- Disrespectful language or personal attacks
- Plagiarizing work from other members or external sources
- Sharing private repository content outside the team without permission
- Using team resources for purely personal or commercial gain

---

## Participation & Access

This is a collaborative effort. Continued access to private repositories depends on **active participation** and respectful conduct.

- Members inactive for 60+ days may have access paused unless arrangements are made
- Members who violate this Code of Conduct may receive a warning, have access revoked, or be removed from the team depending on the severity

---

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this code:
- Reach out directly to a team lead or moderator via GitHub or email
- Or, open a private issue in the `strategy_developement` repo (label it `private`)

All reports will be handled confidentially and respectfully.
