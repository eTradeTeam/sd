[**How To Learn Any Skill So Fast It Feels Illegal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSDprg24pEA)


This video, "How To Learn Any Skill So Fast It Feels Illegal," explores the common mistake of theory overload when learning new skills [0:12]. The speaker introduces the concept of the experiential cycle: experience, observation, adjustment, and experimentation [0:47]. This cycle is crucial for learning because it allows for iterative improvement based on feedback [1:36]. However, many people overload their cognitive resources by trying to learn too much theory at once [2:44], which hinders their progress [3:30].

The speaker uses the analogy of a bow and arrow to explain this. Just as aiming an arrow accurately requires focus on a few key factors, mastering skills requires managing the influx of new information. The video uses two case studies of students, Sesh and Enzo, to illustrate this point. Sesh, covering more material, performed worse due to theory overload [3:08]. Enzo, despite covering less, significantly improved because they prioritized focused practice over rushing through the material [3:36].

The core message is to balance theory and practice. Too much theory without sufficient practice leads to cognitive overload and hinders skill acquisition [4:16]. The video suggests a rule of thumb: for every hour of theory, aim for at least five hours of practice [10:49]. However, this ratio should be adjusted based on the complexity of the skill and the rate at which new habits are formed [11:10]. The video emphasizes that effective learning involves observing how quickly habits are forming; the easier skills become, the more theory can be incorporated without overload [11:35].

Ultimately, the speaker advocates for a gradual and balanced approach to skill development. Prioritizing focused practice to build strong habits is key to creating the mental space for effectively absorbing new information [9:00]. This approach ensures optimal skill growth, avoiding the frustration and failure often associated with rushing the learning process [13:00]. The video's conclusion emphasizes that balancing practice and theory yields smooth and quick skill acquisition [13:07].


[**How to Learn ANYTHING Faster Than Everyone**:]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOjSJVaBV94)

This video, "How to Learn ANYTHING Faster Than Everyone," presents three core principles for accelerated learning. The first is the effort-time exchange, which challenges the common misconception that reducing effort equates to faster learning. Instead, the video argues that investing more effort upfront, through active thinking and engagement [0:37-1:07], leads to stronger memory and deeper understanding, ultimately saving time in the long run [1:07-3:23]. This active engagement is described as reaching the "right level of struggle," and involves actively processing information rather than passively receiving it [3:34-5:10]. Examples include actively engaging with textbooks, taking detailed notes that require thoughtful consideration, and rigorously testing oneself to identify knowledge gaps [3:46-5:10].

The second principle is the omnilearner principle. It debunks the myth of learning styles, asserting that there's no single "best" way to learn for everyone [5:54-7:05]. While visual learning is generally more efficient for most people, developing proficiency across all learning styles – visual, auditory, reading, writing, and kinesthetic – significantly enhances learning speed [6:46-9:13]. The key is learning to organize information regardless of its presentation. The video uses the analogy of a messy room: you can understand the contents without being able to quickly find what you need. Effective learning requires actively organizing the information to optimize access and retention [9:59-12:58].

The third principle, maximizing the iteration effect, emphasizes iterative learning cycles. This involves forming hypotheses about the material, testing those hypotheses through frequent self-assessment [16:57-17:26], and refining understanding based on the results [17:26-19:12]. The video stresses the importance of early and frequent testing, not for self-congratulation but to reveal weaknesses and misconceptions early in the learning process [19:59-21:02]. This prevents wasted time later on correcting significant misunderstandings. The concept of "micro-retrieval," testing immediately after learning, is presented as a particularly effective technique for reinforcing understanding and identifying knowledge gaps [20:35-21:44].

In essence, the video advocates for a proactive approach to learning that prioritizes deep engagement, adaptability to different information formats, and continuous feedback loops. It's not about finding shortcuts or relying on passive consumption, but rather about making the learning process itself more effective and efficient.

The video concludes by offering a free quiz designed to help viewers identify their learning habits, strengths, and weaknesses – allowing them to refine their learning strategies based on their unique "learner type" [14:26-16:03]. This connects the three principles with a practical tool for personalized learning improvement.


[**6 Levels of Thinking Every Student MUST Master**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xqerXscTsE)


This video explores six levels of thinking crucial for effective learning, based on Bloom's revised taxonomy. 

- The first level, remember, focuses on rote memorization and leads to the ability to regurgitate information. 
- The second level, understand, emphasizes comprehension, resulting in the ability to explain concepts. 
- Moving to the application level, apply, involves problem-solving, initially with simple, one-to-one problems, leading to the ability to solve simple problems. [1:13-4:07]
- Level four, analyze, introduces higher-order thinking by comparing and contrasting information. This allows for comparison, enabling learners to identify similarities and differences between concepts. 
- Level five, evaluate, involves judgment and prioritization, leading to the ability to prioritize information based on its importance and relevance. [4:07-10:00]
- Level six, create, involves synthesizing new information and forming hypotheses, leading to the ability to hypothesize. The video highlights that while levels one through three are foundational, mastering levels four and five is key for achieving high-level results in academics and professions. [10:00-13:34]

A significant takeaway is the method for achieving higher levels of thinking. Rather than starting with rote memorization (level one) and progressively moving upwards, the presenter advocates for starting at level five (evaluate) and working downwards. This approach leverages the brain's stronger memory formation at higher levels, enabling a more efficient learning process. [13:34-16:09]

This counterintuitive method addresses the issue of knowledge decay, where lower-level knowledge is forgotten as one progresses to higher levels. By focusing on evaluation and prioritization first, learners solidify their understanding at all levels, leading to a more efficient and effective learning experience. This approach is particularly relevant for students and professionals who seek to achieve top-level results.
