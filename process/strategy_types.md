# Algorithmic Trading Strategy Categories

Algorithmic trading is the systematic use of computer programs to execute trades based on predefined rules and quantitative models. Instead of relying on discretionary or “gut-feel” decisions, algorithmic strategies use indicators, price patterns, or statistical relationships to generate signals. This data-driven approach can help a retail trader manage risk more effectively, reduce emotional bias, and test ideas rigorously using historical market data. 

There are many categories of algorithmic trading strategies—ranging from **Trend Following** and **Mean Reversion** to more advanced techniques like **Machine Learning–Driven** systems—each with its own underlying hypothesis, ideal market conditions, and implementation complexity. By understanding these categories, a trader can better match strategy types to their goals, time horizon, and comfort with technology.

Below is a description of each of the main categories:

## 1. <a id="trend-following"></a>Trend Following

### Description
- **Core idea**: Identify and ride sustained price movements in one direction (up or down). Strategies typically use moving averages or price channel breakouts to detect emerging trends.

### Typical Market Conditions
- Performs best in markets with **strong directional moves** (either bullish or bearish).
- Struggles in choppy or sideways markets.

### Core Principles
- **“Buy high, sell higher”**: Enter after a trend has begun, aiming to capture the middle portion of the move.
- Use trailing stops (e.g., ATR-based) or trendline breaks to exit positions.

### Core Hypothesis

- **“Trends persist due to behavioral biases and institutional flows.”**

### Applicable Securities

- Stocks, ETFs, futures (index, commodity, currency), and even longer-term Forex pairs.

### Implementation Viability
- **Relatively straightforward** to code and test using basic OHLC and volume data.
- Widely supported by built-in indicators (e.g., Moving Average Crossovers) on TradeStation, MultiCharts, NinjaTrader.

### Next Steps
- **Timeframes**: Works for swing/position trading; can also be adapted to intraday if markets trend intraday (e.g., index futures).
- **Recommended** for newer coders wanting a stable framework. Start with simple moving-average or breakout systems before layering complexity.

---

## 2. <a id="mean-reversion"></a>Mean Reversion

### Description
- **Core idea**: Assume prices periodically revert to an average or equilibrium level.  
- Typical indicators: RSI, Bollinger Bands, or Stochastic Oscillators.

### Typical Market Conditions
- Prefers **range-bound** or oscillating markets without strong directional bias.
- Struggles when strong trends emerge.

### Core Principles
- **“Buy dips, sell rips”**: Go long when short-term price action is oversold, go short when overbought.
- Reversion signals often accompanied by short holding periods.

### Core Hypothesis
- **“Prices overextend and then snap back, due to liquidity, profit-taking, or emotional overreaction.”**

### Applicable Securities
- Commonly applied to stocks, ETFs, FX, and index futures.  
- More effective in liquid, lower-volatility instruments.

### Implementation Viability
- **Simple to moderate** coding difficulty: many built-in oscillators exist on retail platforms.
- Risk management crucial: sudden strong trends can cause drawdowns.

### Next Steps
- **Timeframes**: Ideal for intraday or short-swing trades.  
- Start with a simple oscillator-based approach (e.g., RSI(2) oversold/overbought) and gradually refine.

---

## 3. <a id="momentum"></a>Momentum

### Description
- **Core idea**: Buy securities that have shown strong returns over a certain lookback period, expecting outperformance to continue briefly.

### Typical Market Conditions
- Prefers **moderate to high volatility** environments that allow relative outperformance to persist.
- Can overlap with trend-following but typically uses shorter lookback windows.

### Core Principles
- **“Buy winners, sell losers”**: Rank instruments by recent performance and trade top-performers.
- Usually rebalanced periodically (e.g., weekly or monthly in a stock universe).

### Core Hypothesis
- **“Strong performers continue to attract buyers, at least in the short to medium term.”**

### Applicable Securities
- Popular with stocks and ETFs, but can be applied to futures or Forex if relative strength data is available.

### Implementation Viability
- **Moderate**: Requires scanning multiple instruments and ranking them. Still doable in platforms with portfolio-level backtesting (TradeStation RadarScreen, MultiCharts Portfolio Trader, or NinjaTrader Market Analyzer).

### Next Steps
- **Timeframes**: Often used for weekly/monthly rotation systems; can be adapted for shorter intraday momentum in single instruments.
- Requires decent coding skill to handle ranking logic across a watchlist.

---

## 4. <a id="breakout"></a>Breakout

### Description
- **Core idea**: Enter a position when price breaks above resistance or below support, anticipating a burst of directional movement.

### Typical Market Conditions
- Best in **volatile markets** or when news catalysts drive price beyond established ranges.
- Avoids choppy conditions by waiting for clear breakouts.

### Core Principles
- **“Buy the breakout, ride the wave”**: Confirm a breakout with volume or price thresholds.
- Often uses stop orders above/below the boundary to automatically catch the move.

### Core Hypothesis
- **“Key price levels, once broken, lead to rapid moves as stop orders and momentum traders pile in.”**

### Applicable Securities
- Any instrument with well-defined support/resistance (stocks, futures, FX).  
- Particularly popular in index futures or high-volume stocks.

### Implementation Viability
- **Straightforward** for a single instrument: just monitor breakouts of price ranges.  
- **Data**: Standard OHLC/volume typically sufficient.

### Next Steps
- **Timeframes**: Can be intraday (e.g., breakout of the prior day’s range) or swing (e.g., weekly range breakouts).
- Start with simple range-break strategies (Donchian channels) and refine with filters for false breakouts.

---

## 5. <a id="ml"></a>Machine Learning–Driven

### Description
- **Core idea**: Use AI/ML techniques (e.g., regression, classification, neural networks) to identify complex, non-linear relationships in data.

### Typical Market Conditions
- Potentially adaptive to various regimes if well-designed.  
- Performance depends heavily on **data quality** and feature engineering.

### Core Principles
- Data-driven approach. May incorporate multiple inputs (technical indicators, fundamental data, sentiment, etc.).
- Often uses train/test splits and cross-validation to mitigate overfitting.

### Core Hypothesis
- **“Markets contain patterns too subtle for simple heuristics to capture, but ML can uncover them.”**

### Applicable Securities
- Broadly applicable: stocks, futures, FX, options, crypto.  
- Best for instruments with plenty of historical data.

### Implementation Viability
- **Advanced**: Requires programming skills beyond typical retail platforms (Python, R, or specialized ML libraries).  
- Some platforms (e.g., NinjaTrader’s C# or custom add-ons) offer ML integration, but success typically requires specialized knowledge.

### Next Steps
- **Timeframes**: Suited for daily or intraday data, but expect heavy data and computational requirements.  
- Retail traders should **start small**: experiment with simpler techniques (logistic regression) and carefully manage data splits to avoid overfitting.

---

## 6. <a id="sentiment"></a>Market Sentiment

### Description
- **Core idea**: Gauge crowd psychology using sentiment indicators (news, social media, put/call ratios, surveys).

### Typical Market Conditions
- More relevant during **news-heavy or earnings** periods when sentiment can swing quickly.
- Contrarian sentiment strategies thrive in extreme bullish or bearish sentiment.

### Core Principles
- **“Buy fear, sell euphoria”**: Contrarian approach to crowd emotion.  
- Alternatively, follow positive sentiment surges if validated by price action.

### Core Hypothesis
- **“Emotional extremes create exploitable mispricings.”**

### Applicable Securities
- Commonly used in stocks, ETFs, or broad indexes where sentiment data is more readily available.

### Implementation Viability
- **Moderate to advanced**: Basic sentiment measures (e.g., put/call ratio, AAII survey) are easier to integrate than real-time Twitter feed analytics.  
- Many retail platforms do not provide direct text sentiment feeds. Additional data services or custom web-scraping might be needed.

### Next Steps
- **Timeframes**: Often used for multi-day or multi-week trades.  
- Start with widely available sentiment indexes (e.g., VIX, put/call ratio) and see if they improve signals in another core strategy.

---

## 7. <a id="volatility"></a>Volatility Targeting

### Description
- **Core idea**: Adjust position sizes or entry signals based on volatility (e.g., ATR). Aims to achieve more consistent risk/return.

### Typical Market Conditions
- Effective in both trending and mean-reverting environments because it’s primarily about **position sizing** or dynamic stop levels.
- Thrives on stable volatility cycles but can adapt to sudden volatility spikes if well-coded.

### Core Principles
- **“Size positions inversely to volatility”**: Larger positions in low-vol regimes, smaller in high-vol regimes.  
- Helps smooth out equity curve and control drawdowns.

### Core Hypothesis
- **“Controlling volatility stabilizes returns and reduces risk of ruin.”**

### Applicable Securities
- Widely applicable: stocks, futures, Forex. Especially helpful for multi-instrument portfolios.

### Implementation Viability
- **Moderate**: Typically involves a standard indicator (e.g., ATR or historical volatility) to adjust lot sizes.  
- Easy on retail platforms if they allow dynamic position sizing in code.

### Next Steps
- **Timeframes**: Can be used in intraday, swing, or position strategies—volatility scaling is universal.  
- Start by adding ATR-based position sizing to an existing system, then optimize parameters.

---

## 8. <a id="pairs"></a>Pairs Trading (Statistical Arbitrage)

### Description
- **Core idea**: Go long one instrument and short another correlated instrument, betting on a convergence or divergence in their spread.

### Typical Market Conditions
- Profits in **range-bound, mean-reverting** relationships.  
- Good for sideways market phases where direct directional trades struggle.

### Core Principles
- **“Exploit price relationship misalignments”**: Identify historical correlation or cointegration.  
- Position sizing typically hedged to achieve net neutrality.

### Core Hypothesis
- **“Similar or related instruments revert to their historical price spread.”**

### Applicable Securities
- Often used with stocks in the same sector (e.g., two oil companies), ETFs with overlapping holdings, or correlated futures (e.g., Brent vs. WTI).

### Implementation Viability
- **Moderate**: Requires scanning pairs for cointegration/correlation. Some retail platforms can do this with custom code or add-ons.  
- Needs the ability to place and manage simultaneous long/short positions.

### Next Steps
- **Timeframes**: Usually multi-day, although intraday pairs trades exist.  
- Start with stable pairs (e.g., two large-cap stocks with strong historical correlation) and test thoroughly for slippage and borrow costs for shorting.

---

## 9. <a id="calendar"></a>Seasonality / Calendar Effects

### Description
- **Core idea**: Exploit recurring patterns tied to certain times of the day, week, month, or year (e.g., “Santa Claus rally,” monthly rebalancing flows).

### Typical Market Conditions
- Applicable year-round but particularly relevant for corporate earnings cycles, holiday seasons, and known calendar events.

### Core Principles
- **“Pattern recognition in time-based cycles”**: Identify repetitive historical tendencies (e.g., end-of-month inflows).

### Core Hypothesis
- **“Investor behavior and institutional processes (fund flows, rebalancing) create predictable seasonal patterns.”**

### Applicable Securities
- Stocks and futures with well-known seasonal supply/demand cycles (agricultural commodities, energy, equity indexes around earnings cycles).

### Implementation Viability
- **Simple** to code if based on monthly/weekly rules and historical patterns.
- Requires robust backtesting to ensure statistical significance (patterns can decay).

### Next Steps
- **Timeframes**: Generally position or swing trades keyed to specific calendar dates.  
- Start with widely documented seasonal patterns (e.g., “Sell in May,” holiday rallies) and refine with additional filters.

---

## 10. <a id="scalping"></a>Scalping

### Description
- **Core idea**: Execute frequent, very short-term trades aiming to capture small price increments repeatedly.

### Typical Market Conditions
- Thrives in **high liquidity** markets with tight spreads.
- Market must be active enough to generate frequent price fluctuations.

### Core Principles
- **“Take quick profits, cut losses fast”**: High trade frequency, rely on order flow or micro structure.  
- Transaction costs and slippage management are critical.

### Core Hypothesis
- **“Small price discrepancies arise constantly in fast markets and can be systematically harvested.”**

### Applicable Securities
- Highly liquid futures (e.g., ES, NQ), FX majors, or large-cap stocks.  
- Typically not suitable for illiquid instruments due to wide spreads.

### Implementation Viability
- **Advanced**: Requires fast execution, very low latency, and tight spreads.  
- Commission and slippage can erode profits quickly for retail traders.  
- Often less feasible unless you have a robust brokerage platform and excellent internet connectivity.

### Next Steps
- **Timeframes**: Pure intraday, often with 1-minute or tick charts.  
- Demands specialized knowledge of market microstructure. Might be harder for a new algo trader to master profitably.

## 11. <a id="additions"></a>Potential Additions or Tweaks to Strategy Categories

- **Option Strategies (e.g., premium selling, volatility spreads)**: Feasible for a \$100K account, but coding complexity can be higher, especially for multi-leg strategies.  
- **Volume Profile / Order Flow**: Some advanced retail platforms allow direct analysis of level 2 data and volume profiles. Could be integrated under “Scalping” or advanced “Breakout”/“Mean Reversion” contexts.

---

## <a id="next-steps"></a>Next Steps for Each Category

- **Trend Following**: Ideal for swing/position trading; start simple (moving average crossover).  
- **Mean Reversion**: Good for intraday or short-swing trades; build basic RSI or Bollinger Band systems.  
- **Momentum**: Suited to daily or weekly rotation among a basket of stocks/ETFs; more coding to handle scanning.  
- **Breakout**: Good for intraday or multi-day trades; Donchian channels or price channels are a solid start.  
- **Machine Learning**: Tackle only after mastering simpler strategies; requires Python/R or advanced NinjaTrader C# knowledge.  
- **Market Sentiment**: Combine with a simpler base strategy; start with widely available sentiment indicators (e.g., put/call).  
- **Volatility Targeting**: Add volatility-based position sizing to any existing strategy; excellent risk control measure.  
- **Pairs Trading**: Good for multi-day or swing trades; requires correlation testing and multi-instrument code.  
- **Seasonality/Calendar Effects**: Great for part-time traders; set up time-based rules and test thoroughly.  
- **Scalping**: Typically more demanding in terms of execution quality; can be intraday in liquid futures or forex.

---

### <a id="final-thoughts"></a>Final Thoughts
- The above categories cover the most common strategy approaches.  
- For a \$100K account, focus on **risk management** and **strategy robustness** over complexity.  
- Start with simpler strategies (trend following, mean reversion, breakout) before venturing into advanced methods (ML, sentiment, scalping).  
- Always thoroughly backtest and forward-test under different market regimes to ensure real-world feasibility.

This structured foundation should help you pick strategies that align with your trading style, resources, and coding expertise. Each category offers room for innovation, but always keep execution costs, slippage, and realistic fill assumptions in mind for a retail-level environment.
