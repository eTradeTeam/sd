# Our Strategy Development Process

This document provides a **high-level overview** of our end-to-end strategy development workflow. Each stage links to more detailed guidance in other `.md` files within this **Process** directory.

This process is an extension of **Kevin Davy's** [**Strategy Factory Workflow**](./strategy_factory.md):  See: [strategy_factory.md](./strategy_factory.md)


**Each team member** has the flexibility to work across the entire workflow or to specialize in the area that best matches their strengths. For instance, one member might focus on identifying and testing signals, another may concentrate on rigorous strategy testing after feasibility checks, while others might develop the overarching strategy framework, build money management logic, or manage portfolio allocation. This collaborative structure ensures that each individual can pursue their primary interests, knowing that other critical areas are covered by the team.

---

## 1. **Idea Generation & Signal Identification:** [identify_signals.md](./identify_signals.md)

1. **Brainstorming & Research**  
   - Gather potential signals or concepts from market observations, technical indicators, chart patterns, etc.  
   - Encourage a broad range of ideas (even “unorthodox” ones) before filtering them.

2. **Documenting & Recording Signals**  
   - Maintain a structured “signal library” (spreadsheet or `.md` file) describing each idea.  
   - Capture the rationale and any early data references for future review.

- **Detailed steps**: See [identify_signals.md](./identify_signals.md).
   - **Purpose**: Explains how you **discover, document, and validate signals** (indicators, chart patterns, data-driven triggers).  
   - **Contents**:  
     - Approaches to **market structure analysis** (e.g., support/resistance, trendlines).  
     - Systematic ways to keep track of signals (e.g., a “signal library” or spreadsheet).  
     - Techniques for **automating** or partially automating the identification of signals.  
     - Potential next steps: linking these signals to actual strategy code.
---

## 2. **Combine Signals Into Strategies:** [strategies.md](./strategies.md)

1. **Strategy Logic**  
   - Merge one or more signals into a unified set of entry/exit rules.  
   - Define the timeframes (intraday, swing, position) and account for basic risk management (e.g., stops).

2. **Refine & Simplify**  
   - Keep strategies straightforward. Too many parameters or “over-layered” filters often lead to overfitting.

- **More info**: See [strategies.md](./strategies.md).
   - **Purpose**: Describes how **individual signals** are combined into cohesive **strategies** (entry/exit logic, multiple filters, etc.).  
   - **Contents**:  
     - Examples of combining signals (e.g., RSI oversold with a moving average filter).  
     - Guidance on layering different conditions (e.g., confirmations, multi-timeframe checks).  
     - References to your **strategy_categories.md** so users know which category a strategy might fit into.
   - **Strategy Categories Recap**  
     - See [Strategy Types](./strategy_types.md) here.
     - Reference our primary [Strategy Categories](../strategy_categories/README.md) for standard approaches (Trend Following, Mean Reversion, Momentum, etc.).

---

## 3. **Initial Feasibility Testing:** [feasibility_testing.md](./feasibility_testing.md)

1. **Quick Backtests**  
   - Run preliminary checks on a limited data window (e.g., 1–2 years) to see if the strategy has any potential edge.  
   - Eliminate ideas with hopeless performance early on.

2. **Minimum Criteria**  
   - Look for reasonable win rates, drawdowns, or net profits—avoid exhaustive optimization at this stage.

- **Learn more**: Check out [feasibility_testing.md](./feasibility_testing.md).
   - **Purpose**: Outlines the **initial tests** used to screen out ideas that **lack merit** or appear **overly complex**.  
   - **Contents**:  
     - Simple backtest setups on **limited data** (1–2 years) to see if an idea is “in the ballpark.”  
     - Criteria for **discarding** an idea quickly (e.g., extremely high drawdown, no edge vs. random).  
     - Basic code templates for quick feasibility tests on your chosen platform (TradeStation, NinjaTrader, etc.).

---

## 4. **Rigorous Testing & Validation:** [rigorous_test.md](./rigorous_test.md)

1. **Advanced Backtesting**  
   - Extend tests over multiple market regimes or instruments.  
   - Perform **walk-forward analysis**, ensuring parameters remain robust out-of-sample.

2. **Monte Carlo & Parameter Sweeps**  
   - Understand worst-case drawdowns and stress-test performance.  
   - Evaluate whether the strategy performs consistently within a reasonable range of parameter settings.

3. **Multi-Market Testing**  
   - If relevant, see how the strategy fares on correlated or uncorrelated assets (e.g., equities, futures, forex).

- **Procedure details**: Refer to [rigorous_test.md](./rigorous_test.md).
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the **advanced testing** phases, ensuring a strategy is thoroughly vetted.  
   - **Contents**:  
     - **Parameter optimization**: How to avoid overfitting, recommended parameter ranges, and best-practice optimization steps.  
     - **Walk-forward testing**: Rolling windows of in-sample/out-of-sample checks.  
     - **Monte Carlo analysis**: Estimating worst-case drawdowns, ruin probabilities, etc.  
     - **Multi-market testing**: Checking if a strategy is robust across different instruments, timeframes, or sectors.

## 5. **Incubation:** [incubation.md](./incubation.md)

1. **Paper Trading / Forward Watching**  
   - Track the strategy in real-time (without committing full capital) for a defined period (e.g., 3–6 months).  
   - Avoid continuous tweaking—observe how the system handles daily market fluctuations.

2. **Pass/Fail Criteria**  
   - If the strategy remains stable during incubation, it becomes a candidate for live deployment.  
   - If it underperforms significantly, consider discarding or revisiting the logic.

- **Implementation**: See [incubation.md](./incubation.md).
   - **Purpose**: Explains the **paper trading or “forward watch”** phase to see if a strategy holds up in near real-time without risking capital.  
   - **Contents**:  
     - Incubation timeline (e.g., 3–6 months recommended by Kevin Davey).  
     - Criteria for **success** or for deciding to **discard** the system.  
     - Suggestions for **unbiased monitoring** (e.g., not making code tweaks every time there’s a losing streak).

---

## 6. **Strategy Framework Integration:** [Strategy_Framework.md](./Strategy_Framework.md)

1. **Code Standardization**  
   - Embed your strategy logic into the shared framework for **entries, exits, risk rules**, etc.  
   - Use consistent naming conventions and function structures to facilitate collaboration.

2. **Reusability & Modularity**  
   - Write code so that shared modules (e.g., trailing stops, volatility position sizing) can be easily updated or replaced across all strategies.

- **Guidelines**: [Strategy_Framework.md](./Strategy_Framework.md).
   - **Purpose**: Provides a **modular structure** for your code and logic (entries, exits, risk rules) that each new strategy can slot into.  
   - **Contents**:  
     - Common functions or classes (e.g., “Exit conditions,” “Position sizing module,” “Entry triggers”).  
     - Explanation of how strategies should interface with this framework for **consistency** and **code reusability**.  
     - Possibly includes references or examples in TradeStation EasyLanguage, NinjaTrader C#, or MultiCharts PowerLanguage.

## 7. **Money Management:** [Money_Management.md](./Money_Management.md)

1. **Position Sizing & Risk Parameters**  
   - Determine maximum per-trade risk, total portfolio risk, and drawdown thresholds.  
   - Decide on a position-sizing approach (fixed fractional, volatility-adjusted, etc.).

2. **Capital Allocation**  
   - If you trade multiple strategies, monitor correlation and manage overall capital exposure.

- **Further info**: [Money_Management.md](./Money_Management.md).
   - **Purpose**: Focuses on how your team handles **risk and position sizing** across all strategies.  
   - **Contents**:
