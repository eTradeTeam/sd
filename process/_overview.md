Below is a **review** of what typically belongs in the **Process** directory. The overarching goal is to **document each phase** of your trading strategy lifecycle, from initial concept through deployment and beyond. The files in this folder should walk team members through a **standardized, repeatable process**, ensuring every strategy meets rigorous development and testing standards.

   - **Contents**:  
     - Incubation timeline (e.g., 3–6 months recommended by Kevin Davey).  
     - Criteria for **success** or for deciding to **discard** the system.  
     - Suggestions for **unbiased monitoring** (e.g., not making code tweaks every time there’s a losing streak).

7. **Strategy_Framework.md**  
   - **Purpose**: Provides a **modular structure** for your code and logic (entries, exits, risk rules) that each new strategy can slot into.  
   - **Contents**:  
     - Common functions or classes (e.g., “Exit conditions,” “Position sizing module,” “Entry triggers”).  
     - Explanation of how strategies should interface with this framework for **consistency** and **code reusability**.  
     - Possibly includes references or examples in TradeStation EasyLanguage, NinjaTrader C#, or MultiCharts PowerLanguage.

## General Tips

1. **Keep Files as “How-To” Guides**  
   - Each file should be **actionable**: by reading it, a team member should understand **exactly** how to perform that step or sub-step.

2. **Cross-Link Strategically**  
   - Whenever you mention an advanced concept (like Monte Carlo testing in `feasibility_testing.md`), link to the dedicated explanation in `rigorous_test.md`.

3. **Include Code Snippets Where Helpful**  
   - Small code examples or EasyLanguage/C# fragments can be invaluable.  
   - If code is lengthy, consider referencing scripts in a separate folder (like `/scripts` or specialized subfolders).

4. **Maintain Version History**  
   - If you revise your process significantly, note the changes at the top or bottom of each file (or rely on GitHub’s commit history).  
   - This helps keep your process transparent to new collaborators.

5. **Reflect Kevin Davey’s Steps (If Relevant)**  
   - If your process heavily aligns with Davey’s methodology, highlight those parallels. For instance, reference his recommended 100–200 ideas per 1 final system in `identify_signals.md` or `feasibility_testing.md`.

## Conclusion

Your **Process** directory should serve as a **blueprint** for strategy development. Anyone joining the team (or revisiting a particular step) can open these `.md` files and quickly know:

- **What** is expected at that stage.  
- **How** to execute it using consistent tools and methods.  
- **Why** each step matters to building a robust and profitable algorithmic trading system.

Organizing it this way ensures that your entire development cycle—**from raw idea to real-time trading**—remains transparent, consistent, and aligned with your team’s overarching standards.





































Below is a **concise summary** of the recommended files in the **Process** directory, including the newly added **Portfolio_Management.md**. Each file addresses a distinct phase or aspect of your **strategy development pipeline**, ensuring clarity and consistency across the team.

## Why This Structure Works

- **Logical Flow**: Each file represents a **natural phase** of the development pipeline—from brainstorming signals to final portfolio management.  
- **Cross-Referencing**: Documents link to one another (e.g., from feasibility testing to rigorous testing), ensuring developers can find deeper info when needed.  
- **Modularity**: Each `.md` focuses on a specific topic, making it easy to update or expand without disrupting the entire process.  
- **Alignment with Kevin Davey’s Factory Approach**: Each step (feasibility → rigorous test → incubation → final deployment) parallels Davey’s emphasis on systematic, data-driven validation.

## Tips for Maintenance

- **Keep It Updated**: As you refine your methodology, be sure to update the relevant `.md` files.  
- **Version Control**: Rely on GitHub commits and pull requests to track changes, so the team understands each modification.  
- **Review Annually or Quarterly**: Markets evolve, and so do best practices. A scheduled review ensures these documents remain relevant and accurate.  
- **Encourage Team Contributions**: Everyone can contribute improvements (e.g., new ideas for walk-forward configurations or updated money management rules).

By following this **Process directory structure**, you maintain a **transparent, repeatable** development cycle that fosters high-quality, thoroughly tested trading strategies.
