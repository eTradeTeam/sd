Below is a recommended **Portfolio_Management.md** file that you can add to your **Process** directory. It details how multiple strategies can be aggregated into a coherent, risk-controlled portfolio, complementing the rest of the development pipeline.

# Portfolio Management

**Goal**: Combine multiple uncorrelated (or low-correlation) strategies to achieve a **smoother equity curve**, reduce drawdowns, and optimize capital usage.

---

## 1. Why Portfolio Management?

1. **Diversification of Risk**  
   - Different strategies often excel in different market conditions.  
   - By combining them, you mitigate the risk that one strategy’s drawdown coincides with all your trading capital.

2. **Smoother Equity Curve**  
   - Profits from one system can offset losses in another.  
   - Helps reduce volatility of returns, potentially boosting risk-adjusted performance.

3. **Capital Efficiency**  
   - Allocate capital across multiple systems based on expected returns, drawdowns, correlations, or other metrics.  
   - Aim to use margin responsibly without overleveraging.

## 2. Key Concepts

1. **Correlation**  
   - A statistical measure (usually Pearson’s correlation) indicating how similarly two strategies move together.  
   - High correlation (> 0.7) means they often gain/lose at the same time, increasing overall risk.  
   - Low or negative correlation provides better diversification.

2. **Weighting / Allocation**  
   - Each strategy or market might be assigned a certain percentage of the total portfolio.  
   - Can be based on past performance, risk tolerance, or advanced optimization (e.g., mean-variance).

3. **Portfolio-Level Drawdowns**  
   - When combining multiple strategies, track the **aggregate drawdown**.  
   - Even if individual strategy drawdowns are acceptable, they may overlap in certain markets, causing larger combined drawdowns.

4. **Risk Parity** (Optional)  
   - Allocates capital so that each strategy contributes roughly the **same level of risk** (volatility or variance) to the portfolio.  
   - Requires ongoing monitoring of each strategy’s volatility.

## 3. Strategy Selection & Integration

1. **Review Robustness**  
   - Only include strategies that have **passed** [rigorous_test.md](./rigorous_test.md) and ideally **incubation.md** in real-time or sim environments.  
   - A failing or highly volatile system can drag down the entire portfolio.

2. **Volatility & Correlation Checks**  
   - Periodically measure rolling volatility for each strategy.  
   - Calculate correlation or covariance matrix among your active systems to see how they interact.

3. **Capital Allocation Model**  
   - **Fixed Weight** (e.g., 25% to each of four strategies).  
   - **Volatility-Scaled** (risk parity or weighting strategies inversely to their volatility).  
   - **Return/Drawdown–Based** (favor strategies with strong risk-adjusted returns).

4. **Avoid Over-Exposure**  
   - If you have multiple equity-based systems, ensure you aren’t inadvertently doubling or tripling exposure to the same market conditions.  
   - Spread exposure across multiple asset classes if possible (futures, forex, bonds, stocks, etc.).

## 4. Ongoing Monitoring & Rebalancing

1. **Performance Tracking**  
   - Consolidate daily/weekly P/L from each strategy into a single portfolio equity curve.  
   - Identify the largest combined drawdowns and see how they compare to your risk tolerance.

2. **Rebalancing Frequency**  
   - Some traders rebalance monthly or quarterly, resetting each strategy’s capital allocation to maintain target weights.  
   - Overly frequent rebalancing may cause unnecessary transaction costs; too infrequent might cause drift in allocations.

3. **Strategy Health Checks**  
   - If a strategy deviates significantly from its historical performance, investigate whether the environment has changed or if the system is broken.  
   - Consider removing or pausing a struggling system until the cause is found.

4. **Stop-Trading Thresholds**  
   - Each strategy has a set of “stop-trading” rules (e.g., if it exceeds 1.5× historical max drawdown).  
   - At the portfolio level, you may also have a global threshold (e.g., 15–20% total portfolio drawdown). Hitting that level could trigger a partial or full capital pullback.

## 5. Tools & Methods

1. **Backtest Aggregation**  
   - Some platforms (e.g., MultiCharts Portfolio Trader, NinjaTrader with multi-instrument code, or TradeStation’s Portfolio Maestro) let you combine strategies and see consolidated results.  
   - Alternatively, you can export trade-by-trade data to a spreadsheet or Python script for correlation and drawdown analysis.

2. **Monte Carlo at the Portfolio Level**  
   - Combine trades from all strategies in a single dataset.  
   - Perform Monte Carlo resampling to see worst-case portfolio drawdowns.

3. **Correlation Heatmap**  
   - Tools like Python’s pandas or R can quickly compute correlation matrices and produce heatmaps, making it easy to spot high-correlation pairs.

## 6. Best Practices

1. **Start Small**  
   - When going live, begin with minimal capital in each strategy to confirm real-world performance.  
   - Gradually scale up allocations if everything operates smoothly.

2. **Document Allocations**  
   - Keep clear records or `.md` files explaining **why** each strategy is allocated a particular percentage.  
   - Note any changes, along with the rationale (e.g., “Increased System A from 15% to 20% after 6 months of strong performance”).

3. **Review Periodically**  
   - Conduct monthly or quarterly portfolio reviews, possibly aligning with your strategy checkups in [incubation.md](./incubation.md) or other ongoing performance evaluations.

4. **Avoid Emotional Rebalancing**  
   - Don’t drastically shift allocations on short-term results (e.g., one losing month).  
   - Stick to your predefined schedule or triggers.

---

## 7. Potential Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Allocation**  
   - Factor in real-time metrics (volatility, correlation) and adapt allocations more frequently (though with caution).  
   - Could be partially automated if your platform supports advanced logic for multi-strategy risk rebalancing.

2. **Machine Learning–Assisted**  
   - Some advanced traders use ML models to predict which strategy or asset might perform best in the near future.  
   - This is more complex and must be tested thoroughly to avoid overfitting.

3. **Global Position Limits**  
   - If multiple strategies trade the same symbol, set a maximum net long/short position for the portfolio to prevent overlapping risk.

---

## 8. Next Steps

1. **Integrate with Money Management**  
   - The [Money_Management.md](./Money_Management.md) file already covers single-strategy risk. Extend those principles to the portfolio level.  
2. **Portfolio Forward Testing**  
   - If possible, paper-trade the **combined** portfolio or track it in a simulated environment to see real-time synergy or conflicts.  
3. **Continuous Feedback Loop**  
   - As new strategies pass [rigorous_test.md](./rigorous_test.md), incorporate them into the portfolio, or remove underperforming ones that no longer meet the team’s standards.

---

**Conclusion**: A well-managed **portfolio** of uncorrelated strategies provides more consistent returns and reduces single-strategy risk. By carefully **allocating capital**, monitoring correlations, and rebalancing thoughtfully, you’ll build a robust multi-strategy approach that stands up to diverse market conditions.
