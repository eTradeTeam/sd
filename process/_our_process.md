# Our Process

This document provides a **high-level overview** of our end-to-end strategy development workflow. Each stage links to more detailed guidance in other `.md` files within this **Process** directory.



---

## 1. Idea Generation & Signal Identification

1. **Brainstorming & Research**  
   - Gather potential signals or concepts from market observations, technical indicators, chart patterns, etc.  
   - Encourage a broad range of ideas (even “unorthodox” ones) before filtering them.

2. **Documenting & Recording Signals**  
   - Maintain a structured “signal library” (spreadsheet or `.md` file) describing each idea.  
   - Capture the rationale and any early data references for future review.

**Detailed steps**: See [identify_signals.md](./identify_signals.md).

---

## 2. Combine Signals Into Strategies

1. **Strategy Logic**  
   - Merge one or more signals into a unified set of entry/exit rules.  
   - Define the timeframes (intraday, swing, position) and account for basic risk management (e.g., stops).

2. **Refine & Simplify**  
   - Keep strategies straightforward. Too many parameters or “over-layered” filters often lead to overfitting.

**More info**: See [strategies.md](./strategies.md).

---

## 3. Initial Feasibility Testing

1. **Quick Backtests**  
   - Run preliminary checks on a limited data window (e.g., 1–2 years) to see if the strategy has any potential edge.  
   - Eliminate ideas with hopeless performance early on.

2. **Minimum Criteria**  
   - Look for reasonable win rates, drawdowns, or net profits—avoid exhaustive optimization at this stage.

**Learn more**: Check out [feasibility_testing.md](./feasibility_testing.md).

---

## 4. Rigorous Testing & Validation

1. **Advanced Backtesting**  
   - Extend tests over multiple market regimes or instruments.  
   - Perform **walk-forward analysis**, ensuring parameters remain robust out-of-sample.

2. **Monte Carlo & Parameter Sweeps**  
   - Understand worst-case drawdowns and stress-test performance.  
   - Evaluate whether the strategy performs consistently within a reasonable range of parameter settings.

3. **Multi-Market Testing**  
   - If relevant, see how the strategy fares on correlated or uncorrelated assets (e.g., equities, futures, forex).

**Procedure details**: Refer to [rigorous_test.md](./rigorous_test.md).

---

## 5. Incubation

1. **Paper Trading / Forward Watching**  
   - Track the strategy in real-time (without committing full capital) for a defined period (e.g., 3–6 months).  
   - Avoid continuous tweaking—observe how the system handles daily market fluctuations.

2. **Pass/Fail Criteria**  
   - If the strategy remains stable during incubation, it becomes a candidate for live deployment.  
   - If it underperforms significantly, consider discarding or revisiting the logic.

**Implementation**: See [incubation.md](./incubation.md).

---

## 6. Strategy Framework Integration

1. **Code Standardization**  
   - Embed your strategy logic into the shared framework for **entries, exits, risk rules**, etc.  
   - Use consistent naming conventions and function structures to facilitate collaboration.

2. **Reusability & Modularity**  
   - Write code so that shared modules (e.g., trailing stops, volatility position sizing) can be easily updated or replaced across all strategies.

**Guidelines**: [Strategy_Framework.md](./Strategy_Framework.md).

---

## 7. Money Management

1. **Position Sizing & Risk Parameters**  
   - Determine maximum per-trade risk, total portfolio risk, and drawdown thresholds.  
   - Decide on a position-sizing approach (fixed fractional, volatility-adjusted, etc.).

2. **Capital Allocation**  
   - If you trade multiple strategies, monitor correlation and manage overall capital exposure.

**Further info**: [Money_Management.md](./Money_Management.md).

---

## 8. Summaries & Continuous Refinement

1. **Periodic Reviews**  
   - On a monthly or quarterly basis, revisit strategies in incubation and those in live deployment.  
   - Document performance vs. expectations and analyze any deviations.

2. **Strategy Categories Recap**  
   - Reference our primary [strategy_categories.md](../strategy_categories.md) (in the repo root) for standard approaches (Trend Following, Mean Reversion, Momentum, etc.).

3. **Feedback Loop**  
   - Gather insights from live performance.  
   - Feed new or refined ideas back into the pipeline.

---

## Putting It All Together

- **Idea → Signal → Strategy → Quick Feasibility → Rigorous Tests → Incubation → Deployment**  
- At each milestone, rely on the relevant `.md` file for deeper instructions and best practices.

We continuously strive for **repeatability** and **robustness**. This standard process ensures all team members follow common steps and documentation practices, resulting in **transparent, data-driven** trading systems.
