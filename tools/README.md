## Tools Directory Structure

- [**Strategy Development Main**](../README.md)
  - [Tools Main](./tools.md)
    - [Github](./github.md)
    - [Markdown Cheatsheet](./markdown_cheatsheet.md)
    - [VS Code](./vs_code.md)
    - [Communication](./communication.md)
    - [Platform Integrations](./platform_integrations.md)
    - [Additional Resources](./additional_resources.md)

The **Tools** directory collection of resources for collaboration and strategy development.  The goal is to centralize **all resources** - from collaboration guides (GitHub, VS Code tips) to quick-reference materials (Markdown syntax) - so team members can quickly find and learn the tools needed for strategy development.

# Tools Directory Overview

1. [**Overview**](README.md) - This file
   - **Purpose**: Acts as the “home page” for the Tools folder, summarizing each file and what it’s used for.  
   - **What It Covers**:
     - Quick description of the subdirectory’s intent: “All the key tools and tutorials we use for collaboration, coding, and documentation.”  
     - Hyperlinks to the other `.md` files in **Tools** and a short blurb about each.

2. [**Github** ](github.md )
   - **Purpose**: Explains how the team uses GitHub or GitHub Desktop for version control, issue tracking, and pull requests.  
   - **What It Covers**:
     - Cloning the repo, creating branches, committing changes, and PRs.  
     - Basic workflow (feature branching, code reviews).  

3. [**Markdown Cheatsheet** ](markdown_cheatsheet.md) 
   - **Purpose**: Quick reference for Markdown syntax, ensuring consistent `.md` formatting across the team.  
   - **What It Covers**:
     - Headings, lists, links, images, tables, etc.  
     - Best practices for readable `.md` files (e.g., spacing, code blocks).

4. [**VS Code**](vs_code.md)  
   - **Purpose**: Guides team members on installing and configuring Visual Studio Code (or another popular IDE) for trading strategy development.  
   - **What It Covers**:
     - Installation steps and recommended extensions (e.g., bracket pair colorizer, markdown preview).  
     - Git integration with VS Code.  
     - Helpful shortcuts or workspace settings for multi-file editing.

5. [**Communications**](communications.md)  
   - **Purpose**: Provide direct links or instructions for **Discord, Zoom, Slack**, or any other communication channels the team uses.  
   - **What It Covers**:
     - Meeting scheduling, invite instructions, best practices for sharing screens or code snippets.  
   - Alternatively, you may keep this in **Tools/README.md** or in the **Team** folder—wherever it best fits your workflow.

6. [**Platform Integrations**](platform_integrations.md)  
   - **Purpose**: If your team does deeper integrations (like custom scripting for NinjaTrader, specialized tools for TradeStation, etc.), you can have a dedicated file explaining those setups.  
   - **What It Covers**:
     - Steps to connect the platform’s API or environment with your code editor (if relevant).  
     - Any special deployment scripts or tips for debugging in real-time.

7. [**Additional Resources**](additional_resources.md)  
   - **Purpose**: Catchall for external links and resources that support day-to-day tasks (e.g., recommended websites for market data, known third-party libraries, etc.).  
   - **What It Covers**:
     - Free or paid data sources.  
     - Tools like `Python` libraries for advanced analytics, AI frameworks, or spreadsheet add-ons for trade tracking.
