### Why This Structure Works

- **genai** Subdirectory:  
  - Centralizes your AI resources, making it clear how the team intends to use generative AI.  
  - Encourages best practices and consistent approaches for ethically and effectively leveraging AI outputs.

- **Tools** vs **genai**:  
  - **Tools** is primarily for core software, platforms, coding resources, and communications.  
  - **genai** is specifically about process, methodology, and case studies that incorporate AI into strategy development.

- **Consistent Naming and Corrections**:  
  - Files like `incubation.md` and `feasibility_testing.md` have corrected spellings.  
  - Subdirectory names are lowercased, consistent with typical GitHub conventions.

- **Cross-Linking Potential**:  
  - Within your `our_process.md` or `rigorous_test.md`, you might reference AI usage found in the `genai` folder, guiding team members to see how AI can assist at each stage.

By adopting this updated ToC, your **strategy_development** repository will be well-organized, with **clear delineation** of responsibilities, processes, and the new generative AI component. This ensures every contributor knows where to find resources, how to add content, and how to properly experiment with AI while maintaining robust trading strategy development practices.
